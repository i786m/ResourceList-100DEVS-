# ResourceList-100DEVS-
A centralised list of resources for and/or from the 100Devs.
************************************************************

Hello Fellow Devs,

I've been thinking of a way to keep track of all the awesome resources we are coming across in our time during the bootcamp.

I think a centralised list will help everyone as its a one stop shop and can be updated by anyone(as such please be mindful).

## Please take the time to read the code of conduct file  and the contribution guidelines set out below.


There are a number of files that have now been created in order to make finding resources easy


Please try to follow the following convention when adding a resource:



1) Try to add the resource to the file you think it best fits in.

2) To add to the list select a file and click on the pencil icon to edit the file

3) If you are adding a link please add a brief description as to what the link is for.

4) Try to ensure that you are not posting a duplicate resource.

5) Seperate entries with a row of asterisks* to help keep it readable.

6) Lastly when adding changes select the second option that says:

     Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Learn more about pull requests.
 
   Then hit propose changes.


Happy Sharing!

If anyone is willing to help maintain the resource list please feel free to let me know via DM on discord (@Imran Mohamed)!
